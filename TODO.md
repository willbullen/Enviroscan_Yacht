## ðŸ”„ **RECENT STRUCTURAL CHANGES**

### **Project-Centric Architecture (December 2024)**
- [x] **Restructured Build Management Module**
  - [x] Removed vessel-wide tabs from main interface
  - [x] Made Projects the primary navigation focus
  - [x] Drawings, Issues, Documents, and 3D Models now exist only within project context
  - [x] Simplified interface with Dashboard and Projects tabs only
  - [x] Enhanced project detail views contain all sub-modules
  - [x] Removed vessel-wide API endpoints to maintain clean architecture
  - [x] Updated all component interfaces to be project-specific

**Rationale:** This change provides a cleaner, more intuitive user experience where users:
1. Select a vessel (via vessel context)
2. Select a project within that vessel
3. Access all project-related data (drawings, issues, documents, 3D models) within the project scope

This eliminates confusion between vessel-wide and project-specific data while maintaining the hierarchical relationship: **Vessel â†’ Projects â†’ Project Data**.
