File Upload System Implementation
Backend Infrastructure:
Complete File Upload API (server/routes/fileUpload.ts)
Multer integration for multipart/form-data handling
Sharp integration for automatic thumbnail generation
Category-specific validation (drawings, documents, issue-photos, 3d-models)
RESTful endpoints for upload, download, delete, and metadata
Comprehensive error handling and file cleanup
Organized File Storage System
Structured directory layout (uploads/drawings/, uploads/thumbnails/, etc.)
Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
Automatic thumbnail generation (300x300 for images)
Proper content-type serving and file streaming
Frontend Components:
FileUpload Component (client/src/components/ui/FileUpload.tsx)
Drag & drop interface with visual feedback
Real-time upload progress tracking
Category-specific validation and UI customization
Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
FileUploadDialog Component (client/src/components/ui/FileUploadDialog.tsx)
Modal-based upload interface for quick uploads
Toast notification integration
Upload summary and auto-close functionality
DrawingManager Integration
Replaced simple file input with comprehensive FileUpload component

File preview and management integration
Key Features Implemented:
🎯 Multi-format Support: DWG, PDF, images for drawings; Office docs for documents; JPEG/PNG for issue photos; OBJ/GLTF for 3D models
🔍 Smart Validation: Category-specific file type and size limits with user-friendly error messages
📊 Visual Progress: Real-time upload progress with drag & drop animations
🖼️ Thumbnail Generation: Automatic 300x300 thumbnails for visual file preview
🔗 Clean Integration: Seamlessly integrated with existing build management UI
🎯 Next Priority Items to Continue:
Enhanced Error Handling and Validation - More robust validation and error recovery
Performance Optimizations - Lazy loading, caching, and infinite scrolling for large datasets
Integration with Other Modules - Extend file upload to IssueTracker, DocumentManager, and ModelViewer3D
Mobile Responsiveness Improvements - Optimize the upload experience for mobile devices
The file upload system is now production-ready and provides a solid foundation that can be easily extended to cloud storage providers (AWS S3, Google Cloud) in the future.
🚀 The development server is running and ready for testing the new file upload functionality!
