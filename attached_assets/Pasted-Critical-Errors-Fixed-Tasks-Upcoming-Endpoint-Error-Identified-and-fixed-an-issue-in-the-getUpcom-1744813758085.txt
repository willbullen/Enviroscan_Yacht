Critical Errors Fixed
Tasks/Upcoming Endpoint Error:
Identified and fixed an issue in the getUpcomingMaintenanceTasks method in the DatabaseStorage class
The method was using incorrect status filtering (looking for "upcoming" which didn't match the data schema)
Fixed date filtering issues in the query
Updated to retrieve tasks due within the next 30 days with "pending" status
Implementation Approach
Replit AI is following a systematic approach, starting with fixing critical errors before moving to UI/UX improvements
They've made a commit with the description: "Fixes a problem showing upcoming tasks"
They're examining server-side code to identify and fix backend issues first
Current Status
One critical error has been fixed (tasks/upcoming endpoint)
Replit AI is asking for confirmation to continue with other sections of the app to identify additional issues
They appear to be following our recommendation to prioritize critical errors before UI/UX improvements
Areas Still Needing Implementation
Critical Errors
Other potential backend errors in different endpoints have not yet been addressed
No mention of fixing the negative "Days Until" values in Predictive Maintenance
No mention of addressing duplicate crew members in Crew Management
Code Structure Improvements
No evidence yet of implementing the recommended project structure reorganization
No implementation of consistent component patterns
No implementation of React Context for state management
UI/UX Improvements
No implementation yet of the design system
No implementation of responsive layouts
No implementation of navigation improvements with active state indicators
No implementation of the notification system
Section-Specific Improvements
No implementation yet of Dashboard improvements
No implementation of Tasks improvements (filtering, sorting, etc.)
No implementation of Equipment management enhancements
No implementation of Inventory improvements
No implementation of other section-specific enhancements
Performance Optimizations
No implementation yet of code splitting
No implementation of memoization
No implementation of virtualization for large data sets
Next Steps for Replit
Continue fixing critical errors:
Identify and fix remaining backend issues
Address UI rendering issues (like negative "Days Until" values)
Fix duplicate data issues (like duplicate crew members)
