# Current Issues and Bugs in Yacht Management Application

## Overview
This document identifies and categorizes current issues and bugs in the Eastwind Yacht Management application based on a thorough review of all sections. Issues are categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and by section.

## Critical Issues

### Crew Management
1. **Duplicate Crew Members**: Multiple instances of the same crew members appear in the list:
   - John Smith (Captain) appears twice with identical information
   - Maria Garcia (Chief Engineer) appears twice with identical information
   - Robert Chen appears as both Deckhand and First Officer (potentially legitimate if different roles, but suspicious)
   - Sophia Williams (Chief Stewardess) appears twice with identical information
   
   This issue was identified in previous recommendations but remains unfixed.

### Predictive Maintenance
1. **Negative "Days Until" Values**: The "Days Until" values for maintenance predictions may be calculated incorrectly, potentially showing negative values for past due maintenance.

## High Priority Issues

### Equipment
1. **Service Overdue Indicators**: Multiple equipment items show "Service Overdue" warnings, but no clear action path is provided:
   - Main Engine - Port (Next Service: Jun 10, 2023)
   - Main Engine - Starboard (Next Service: Jun 10, 2023)
   - Generator 1 (Next Service: Feb 15, 2023)
   - Generator 2 (Next Service: Jul 20, 2023)
   - Radar System (Next Service: May 5, 2023)
   - Liferaft - Port (Next Service: Jan 30, 2023)

2. **Inconsistent Date Formats**: Dates are displayed in different formats across the application (MM/DD/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, etc.).

### Reports
1. **Truncated Text in Charts**: The Equipment Status chart shows truncated text for "Non-Operational" status.

2. **Limited Data Visualization**: The Task Completion Trend chart shows only a single data point, limiting its usefulness for trend analysis.

### Financial Management
1. **Missing Functionality**: Several tabs (Journal Entries, Banking, Budgets, etc.) appear to be placeholders with no actual functionality.

## Medium Priority Issues

### Dashboard
1. **Limited Dashboard Customization**: No options to customize the dashboard widgets or layout.

2. **Static Information Cards**: The information cards (Tasks Due Today, Upcoming Tasks, etc.) don't appear to be interactive.

### Tasks
1. **Limited Filtering Options**: Basic filtering by status is available, but no advanced filtering by equipment type, assigned person, or date range.

2. **Inconsistent Task Actions**: Some tasks have "Start Task" buttons while others have "Mark Complete" buttons, but the logic behind this isn't clear.

### Inventory
1. **No Low Stock Alerts**: While the Dashboard shows "0" inventory items low on stock, there's no clear threshold setting for when items should be flagged as low.

2. **Limited Inventory Management**: No functionality for inventory transactions, history, or automated reordering.

### ISM Management
1. **Limited Document Management**: Basic document listing is available, but no version control, approval workflows, or document lifecycle management.

### Calendar
1. **Limited Calendar Functionality**: The calendar shows scheduled tasks but lacks features like drag-and-drop rescheduling, recurring tasks, or calendar export.

## Low Priority Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Inconsistent Button Styles**: Different button styles and colors are used throughout the application without clear meaning.

2. **Limited Responsive Design**: The application may not display optimally on different screen sizes.

3. **No Dark Mode**: No option for dark mode or theme customization.

### Settings
1. **Limited Settings Options**: Only basic yacht profile settings are available, with placeholder tabs for Appearance and Notifications.

2. **No User Management**: No functionality for managing users, roles, or permissions.

## Implementation Progress Assessment

Based on previous recommendations, the following improvements were supposed to be implemented:

### Implemented
1. **Fixed tasks/upcoming endpoint**: The backend issue with the getUpcomingMaintenanceTasks method in the DatabaseStorage class has been fixed.

### Not Implemented
1. **Duplicate crew members**: This issue was identified previously but remains unfixed.

2. **Negative "Days Until" values**: This issue was identified previously but remains unfixed.

3. **Code structure improvements**: No evidence of implementing the recommended project structure reorganization.

4. **State management**: No implementation of React Context for state management.

5. **UI/UX improvements**: No implementation of the design system, responsive layouts, or navigation improvements.

6. **Section-specific improvements**: No implementation of the recommended enhancements for Dashboard, Tasks, Equipment, Inventory, etc.

7. **Performance optimizations**: No implementation of code splitting, memoization, or virtualization.

## Conclusion
While one critical backend issue (tasks/upcoming endpoint) has been fixed, most of the previously recommended improvements have not been implemented. The application still suffers from several critical and high-priority issues that affect data integrity and user experience. The duplicate crew members issue is particularly concerning as it indicates potential data management problems that could affect other areas of the application.
